			<h2>Call For Papers</h2>
   
    <p>SecureMDE seeks contributions that provide novel results on the integration of
security tools and techniques in MDE development, as well as work-in-progress or
experience reports that provide insight into early adoption or requirements.
SecureMDE also looks forward to receiving papers summarizing the state-of-the art and
future vision in the general field of MDE for the development and analysis of
systems with security requirements.</p>

<p>Topics of the workshop will include (among others):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Model-driven development of secure software and systems</li>
  <li>Domain-specific modeling languages (DSML) for secure software</li>
  <li>Modeling of access control and privacy policies</li>
  <li>Model-based generation of test cases for security policies</li>
  <li>Model-based dynamic security adaptation</li>
  <li>Model-based security reverse-engineering and analysis</li>
  <li>Model-based security evolution and co-evolution</li>
  <li>Model-based verification techniques for security properties</li>
  <li>Threats, vulnerability, and trust modeling</li>
  <li>Security systems and languages for MDE</li>
  <li>Cryptography and obfuscation for MDE</li>
  <li>IP protection for MDE</li>
  <li>Requirements for/needs in MDE security</li>
  <li>MDE for Block-chain technologies and Smart contracts</li>
  <li>Case studies and experience reports</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="paper-submission">Paper Submission</h3>

<p>SecureMDE will accept two types of papers: <strong>research/technical papers</strong> of 10 to 12 pages, and <strong>position
statements</strong> of 6 to 7 pages. Papers should be submitted in PDF and conform to
Springer’s LNCS format. All submissions must be original work and must not have
been previously published, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere.
At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the event and
participate fully in the workshop. All submissions will be formally evaluated by
three reviewers; All accepted papers will be published digitally in the
STAF’18 Workshop Post-Proceedings published with Springer LNCS.</p>
