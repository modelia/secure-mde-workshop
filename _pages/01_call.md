SecureMDE seeks contributions that provide novel results on the integration of
security tools and techniques in MDE development, as well as work-in-progress or
experience reports that provide insight into early adoption or requirements.
SecureMDE also looks forward to receiving papers summarizing the state-of-the art and
future vision in the general field of MDE for the development and analysis of
systems with security requirements. 

Topics of the workshop will include (among others):

 * Model-driven development of secure software and systems
 * Domain-specific modeling languages (DSML) for secure software
 * Modeling of access control and privacy policies
 * Model-based generation of test cases for security policies
 * Model-based dynamic security adaptation
 * Model-based security reverse-engineering and analysis
 * Model-based security evolution and co-evolution
 * Model-based verification techniques for security properties
 * Threats, vulnerability, and trust modeling
 * Security systems and languages for MDE
 * Cryptography and obfuscation for MDE
 * IP protection for MDE
 * Requirements for/needs in MDE security
 * MDE for Block-chain technologies and Smart contracts 
 * Case studies and experience reports
 * MDE for human/social side in security
 * MDE using Artificial Intelligence to improve security


### Paper Submission

SecureMDE will accept two types of papers: **research/technical papers** of 10 pages, and
position statements of 5 pages.

 Papers should be submitted in PDF and conform to
 <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template ">ACM</a> format. 

All submissions will be formally evaluated by three reviewers; different review criteria will be used for research/technical submissions versus position statements. The former will be assessed based on their novelty, alignment with workshop call, evaluation, and ability to generate discussion. The latter will be evaluated in terms of likelihood of sparking heated debate/discussion at the workshop. Paper submissions will be made electronically via the workshop submission web page, using the Easychair service. All submissions must be original work and must not have been previously published, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the event and participate fully in the workshop.

Manuscripts must be submitted as PDF files through the EasyChair online submission system:
